Hi, I'm @FakhrulNazmi 👋

I'm interested in mobile app development, innovative technologies, and collaborative projects that make a difference. 👀
I'm currently learning mobile development using React Native and Flutter. 🌱
I'm looking to collaborate on mobile app projects that focus on social impact, health, or education. If you have an idea, let's build something amazing together! 💞️

Fun fact: I'm a coffee aficionado and a fan of sci-fi movies. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying out new coffee recipes or watching the latest sci-fi series. ⚡
